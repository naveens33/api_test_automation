# Web Service
web services include any software, application, or cloud technology that provides standardized web protocols (HTTP or HTTPS) to interoperate, communicate, and exchange data messaging – usually XML (Extensible Markup Language) – throughout the internet.

In other words, web services are XML-centered data exchange systems that use the internet for A2A (application-to-application) communication and interfacing. These processes involve programs, messages, documents, and/or objects.

A key feature of web services is that applications can be written in various languages and are still able to communicate by exchanging data with one another via a web service between clients and servers. A client summons a web service by sending a request via XML, and the service then responses with an XML response. Web services are also often associated with SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture).

To break that down, a web service comprises these essential functions:

* Available over the internet or intranet networks
* Standardized XML messaging system
* Independent of a single operating system or programming language
* Self-describing via standard XML language
* Discoverable through a simple location method
